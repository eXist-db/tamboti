                    Access to James Sanua’s journal publications and his extensive oeuvre has hitherto been difficult. 
                    The journalistic and artistic material of the Paris-exiled Egyptian nationalist has therefore hardly received the degree of scholarly attention it actually deserves. 
                    Yet, during the research-work for her Ph.D. dissertation “The Construction of a National-Self through the Definition of its Enemy in James Sanua’s Early Satirical Writings” 
                    Eliane Ursula Ettmueller was able to collect James Sanua’s complete works and -– even more importantly -– the majority of the originals of his magazines. 
                    Mrs Eva Milhaud kindly gave her permission to have Sanua’s legacy digitized and to make it available to interested readers and researchers all over the world.

                    The Priya Paul Collection of Popular Art contains more than 4,200 illustrations from the late 19th and the 20th century.
                    It is one of the finest collections of ephemera like old posters, calendars, postcards, commercial advertisements, textile labels and cinema posters in India. 
                    In a collaborative endeavor with Tasveerghar the collection was digitized and is now being annotated by local and international experts.
