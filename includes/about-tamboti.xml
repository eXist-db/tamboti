    <p> Tamboti is an application for working with metadata based on the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/" target="_blank">MODS</a> standard.</p>
    <p> MODS is a standard used to catalogue books, articles and other traditional library
        material, and visual or online material such as images, videos, web sites or other sources.</p>
    <p> Tamboti is similar to the public interface (OPAC) of the library systems
        used by national and university libraries. Tamboti can process a large amount of records.</p>
    <p> In Tamboti, you can annotate records with metadata concerning language, script and
        transcription. This function is important for records used in multi-lingual contexts.</p>
    <p> In Tamboti, you can catalogue materials through a form-based interface. </p>
    <br/>
