        <para> To search in material that is open to everybody, you do not need to log in. </para>
        <para>To search in records created by you, in material that is shared with you, and in material that is open to groups you belong to, log in and perform the required action. </para>
        <para>Even after you have logged log in, you will not see all material in the database,
            since it is likely that there are other users who keep at least some of their records
            private to themselves.</para>
        <para>The material that you wish to keep to yourself cannot be seen by anybody else, unless
            you choose to allow this. By default, all records you create are hidden to others. Below, it will be explained how you go about sharing your
            material, should you choose to do so.</para>
        <para>In this way, a project can develop a bibliography, keeping the draft visible to all project members and editable by some project members, for instance, before publishing it to the world at large. </para>
